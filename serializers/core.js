// Four distinct eras of Grid.
// V1 - 2006-2008
// V2 - 2008-?
// V3 - 2016-2017
// V4 - 2017-?

// V1 uses a very early version with rudimentary soap envelopes
// V2 is more up-to-spec with SOAP, but has some artifacts of old era
// V3 is what we know as the general soap protocol
// V4 uses V3 just with json for everything
